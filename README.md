## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio (Giraffe or later recommended)
- Android device or emulator running Android 7.0 (API 24) or higher
- A [Spotify Developer Account](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) to obtain API credentials
- (Optional) A real device for Spotify playback

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repo**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/print-ramcharan/party-playlist-maker.git
   cd party-playlist-maker
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**
   - Open the project folder in Android Studio.

3. **Configure Spotify API Credentials**
   - Create an app on the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).
   - Add a redirect URI (e.g., `partyplaylistmaker://callback`).
   - Retrieve your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   - In your project, create a file called `local.properties` (if it doesn't exist).
   - Add:
     ```
     SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
     SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=partyplaylistmaker://callback
     ```
   - Or, for runtime, update `Constants.kt` or wherever credentials/redirects are referenced.

5. **Build and Run**
   - Click **Run** in Android Studio or use:
     ```sh
     ./gradlew installDebug
     ```

## Spotify API Integration

This app uses the [Spotify Android Authentication Library](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/android/) for login and [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) for music search, playback, and playlist management.

- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code Flow)
- **Scopes Required:**
  - `user-read-private`
  - `playlist-modify-public`
  - `playlist-modify-private`
  - `streaming`
  - `user-modify-playback-state`
  - `user-read-playback-state`
- **Redirect URI:** Must match the one set in your Spotify developer dashboard and app code.

### How OAuth Works in the App

1. User clicks "Login with Spotify".
2. App launches Spotify login in a browser.
3. On success, the user is redirected back to the app via the custom URI.
4. Access token is used for all further Spotify API calls.

---

## Usage

1. **Login:** Start the app and log in with your Spotify account.
2. **Create a Party:** Tap "Create Party" to generate a new playlist session.
3. **Invite Friends:** Share the session code or invite link.
4. **Search & Add Songs:** Use the search bar to find and add songs from Spotify.
5. **Vote:** Upvote or downvote songs to change their position in the playlist.
6. **Playback:** Use the in-app player to stream music directly (Spotify Premium required for playback).
7. **End Party:** The session creator can end the party; playlists and votes are saved for future reference.
